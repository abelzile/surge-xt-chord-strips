# surge-xt-chord-strips
TouchOSC chord strip interface for Surge XT inspired by the chord strips in GarageBand

- TouchOSC .tosc files are XML files that have been zlib compressed.
- An easy way to uncompress them is to open them in the TouchOSC editor and export to XML.
- After modifying the XML file it can be opened in the TouchOSC editor by changing the file extension from .xml to .tosc.
    - The file does not have to be zlib compressed first.
    - The extension must be changed or the editor will complain.
